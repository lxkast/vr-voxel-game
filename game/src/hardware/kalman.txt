State modelled as 7 doubles, first 4 representing the current quaternion, last 3 representing the current euler rotational velocity.
Initialised as {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
Predict step:
    Multiply quaternion state by new quat
    Leave rv constant

Update step gyro:
    h(x) = Set euler rotational velocity to value read, update current quaternion

 Update step accel:
    h'(x) = Set quaternion to make gravity vector make sense
